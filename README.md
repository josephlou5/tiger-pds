# Tiger Package Delivery Service (PDS)

Tiger PDS is a website for making package deliveries easy for Princeton
University students. Packages shipped to a student will always arrive at Frist
Campus Center, but by using this app, they will be able to get the packages
picked up from Frist and delivered right to their door!

## Deployment

This app has been deployed through [Render](https://render.com) at
https://tiger-pds.onrender.com.
